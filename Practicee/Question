1. Print the sum of N natural numbers where N is an integer input by the user.

Problem: We are given a positive integer N by the user. Our task is to calculate the sum of the first N natural numbers and print it out. Natural numbers are simply numbers that you naturally count, i.e., 1, 2, 3, and so on.

For example, if N is 5, we want to calculate the sum 1+2+3+4+5, which equals 15.

2). Print the factorial of a number.

Problem: We're given an integer 'N' by the user. Our task is to calculate the factorial of this number and print it. The factorial of a number is the product of all positive integers up to that number.

For example, the factorial of 5 (denoted as 5!) is 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120.

Approach: To find the factorial, we'll start with a product of 1 (since multiplying by 1 doesn't change a number) and then multiply it by every number from 1 to N.
